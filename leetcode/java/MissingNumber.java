/**
 * Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

 For example,
 Given nums = [0, 1, 3] return 2.

 Note:
 Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?
